# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 1


This is one of my Favorite labs because it was our first lab and I didnt really know what to expect from it. In this lab we mainly just got
familiar with the linux system. Luckily my partner and I managed to complete the lab without any issues.


Lab 6 Part-2


This is my second Favorite lab because I enjoy playing black jack. In this lab we had to come up with a strategy to determine when someone busts.
We also had to find a way to determine whether the card was a face card, number card, or an Ace. Although we did run in to a couple of problems
I still enjoyed working in this lab.


Lab 12 both parts


I Liked this lab because it is our last lab of the semester. Another reason why I like this lab is because we got to learn a little bit about
RGB which I found interesting. I also learned that random number generators are theoretically not truly random in a mathematical sense.
